        <h3>Day One: July 10th, 2017</h3>
        <p>I parked on the beach parking lot and was able to see the waves crash.
          I thought I had arrived too early, but many people were here already.
          I took a tour of all the Google buildings! It is amazing. I am known as Gnarly Nick.
          I learned Command Line, HTML, CSS. I have started to make my own website.
          Plus, there are so many snacks!! I am really enjoying it.

        <h3>Day Two: July 11th, 2017</h3>
        <p>I am starting to get used to the LA traffic, but I don't like it. Today, we attacked JavaScript.
          I like JavaScript because the problems are like brain-teasers. I continued to work on my website.
          We learned functions and loops in JavaScript. I am starting to get used to being at Google LA.

        <h3>Day Three: July 12th, 2017</h3>
        <p>Today we learned about the jQuery library. jQuery allows me to make my website more
          interactive with the user. However, in order for me to use jQuery, I need to learn
          about how to write the code based on the library instructions.
          It is a lot of reading and practicing, but that is the only way to get better!!

        <h3>Day Four: July 13th, 2017</h3>
        <p>Today we started Python. I find Python easier to comprehend than jQuery.
          I feel really appreciative
          to be able to experience this with such tremendous people.

        <h3>Day Five: July 14th, 2017</h3>
        <p>Today, we continued to learn python. I learned about Dictionaries, Classes, and Modules.
          Dictionaries are a very useful way of storing information. Today is the last day of week one.
          The first week was so fun! It was better than I ever could have imagined.
          I cannot wait to see what else is in store.

        <h3>Bonus Day: July 15th, 2017</h3>
        <p>Today we went for a group bonding exercise to Westwood and then escape rooms.
          My group escaped in time. It was really fun! I would love to do it again!
